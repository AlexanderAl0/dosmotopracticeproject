                            wash brush is the biggest of the lot with a square end and medium 
                            to long hairs. It is ideal for varnishing because it gives the 
                            maximum coverage smoothly and quickly what with it being thicker 
                            than any other brushes. It gives nice bold strokes and its edge 
                            can be used to create fine lines, straight edges, and stripes.

                        <h3 class="uppercase brush-type">Angled Brush</h3><p class="desc">As the name suggests 
                            the angled brush has an angled or slanted tip. This is the reason why it 
                            is also known as the slanted brush. Some might even call it shader due to 
                            its flexibility when it comes to filling small areas to bigger ones without 
                            any effort. It is a perfect brush for curved strokes and filling corners.

                        <h3 class="uppercase brush-type">Flat Brushes</h3><p class="desc">Think of flat brush as 
                            the mini version of the wash brush. Where the wash brush has bristles 
                            with slightly round edges and is very thick, the flat brush is not so 
                            much. The flat brush is perfect to use when you want a lot of paint 
                            coverage and the surface you are working on is small for a wash brush. 
                            Not to mention that this brush will allow you to maneuver it more easily.

                            exactly like the name suggests - a fan. It is flat and has spread hairs 
                            and is an ideal choice when you are planning to paint nature elements and 
                            landscapes. It can even be used for blending backgrounds or adding subtle 
                            highlights to darker areas. You can pick a fan brush with natural hairs which 
                            are great for smoothing, blending and feathering.<strong><br><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=wash+brushes+art&crid=Z8DNBU4BH2NP&sprefix=wash+brush+art%2Caps%2C119&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"

                            effect of floating on the wall. Our Floating Frame uses frame-grade acrylic to add UV 
                            protection and subtract weight, and features contemporary brass-coated hardware — 
                            understated, one-of-a-kind accents that give it surprising depth and dimension.

                            creates a subtle shadow within, adding dimension where once there was none.
                            Our Deep-Set Frame is ideal for showcasing landscape or travel photos that 
                            welcome pause.

                            in heavy body acrylics. They are perfect for all kinds of techniques, whether you're using them
